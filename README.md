# weatherdash

WeatherDash is a simple javascript application using AJAX calls to render current conditions and 5 day forecast data from the openweather API. The search function allows you to display the aforementioned data by city name and will also save searched cities to localStorage. The UI includes a list of max size 4 that shows the last searched cities that were saved from localStorage as clickable elements that will re-render the forecast and current condition data. The page will also automatically load the last searched city (again, stored in localStorage). The website is entirely mobile responsive.
